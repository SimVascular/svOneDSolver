Input File Guide
================

Nomenclature
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section of the documentation, the following nomenclature will be used:

* *Card* refers to a command in a line of the input file. 
* A *field* is a single string (no space separators) or number that forms a Card, i.e., a command in the input file.
* A *segment* is a straight segment of vasculature with tapered circular cross section. It connects two joints, one joint and one inlet/outlet or directly one inlet with one outlet. 
* A *joint* is a connection between segments that ensures a unique pressure value and mass continuity.
* A *data table* is a table that can be used to specify scalar and time-varying quantities.

Units
^^^^^

In what follows, we assume that the model quantities and associated boundary conditions are always specified in CGS units. 

MODEL Card
^^^^^^^^^^

This card allows the user to specify a name for the model that will be used when generating the output files. If, for example, we want to call our model *Artery*, we need to specify the following line ::

  MODEL Artery

The following field is required:
1. Model Name (string)

INCLUDE Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This card is used to recursively include input files in the project. An example is ::

  INCLUDE auxFile.in TRUE

The following fields are required:

1. Name of the file to include (string, no space separation)
2. Activate file. The following two options are supported: 

  * TRUE. The file is included in the current model
  * FALSE. The file is not used. 


NODE Card
^^^^^^^^^^

This card is used to specify the coordinates of a connection between vessel segments. An example is ::

  NODE 0 1.0 2.0 3.0

The following fields are required:

1. Node Number (double)
2. Node X Coordinate (double)

JOINT Card
^^^^^^^^^^

This card is used to specify a connection between vessel segments. By entering the inlet and outlet vessel segments is it possible to enforce a unique value of pressure in the junction and a flow rate that satisfy conservation of mass. An example is ::

The following fields are required:

1. Joint Name (string)
2. Joint Node (double)

JOINTINLET Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This card is used to specify a list of segments ID numbers as inlets for a joint entity. An example is ::

This means that the joint inlet named as *IN0* has 3 inlets with segment ID equal to 2, 4, and 5 respectively. 

The following fields are required:

1. Inlet Name (string)
2. Total Number of segments (int)
3. List of segments (list of int)


JOINTOUTLET Card

This means that the joint outlet named as *OUT0* has 3 inlets with segment ID equal to 2, 4, and 5 respectively. 

The following fields are required:

1. Outlet Name (string)
2. Total Number of segments (int)
3. List of segments (list of int)


SEGMENT Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The segment card is used to specify vessel segments. An example is ::

15. *Outlet* Boundary Condition Type. The following *outlet* boundary conditions are supported:

  * *NOBOUND*. No outlet boundary condition (used for internal segment outlets).
  * *FLOW*. Time-varying outlet flow rate. 
  * *RESISTANCE*. Constant resistance in model units. 
  * *RCR*. Boundary condition specified through an RCR circuit.

16. Data Table Name for boundary condition (string)

DATATABLE Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This cards is used to directly specify constant and time-varying quantities for inlet/outlet boundary conditions. It also computes admittance and impedance from a parametric definition of the downstream vessel morphometry. An example with a constant inlet flow rate of 14.0 is::

  DATATABLE INLETDATA LIST
  0.0 14.0 
  10.0 14.0
  ENDDATATABLE

An example with a time-varying inlet flow rate is::

  DATATABLE INLETDATA LIST
  0.0 14.0 
  1.0 20.0
  2.0 50.0
  2.5 89.2
  3.5 110.0
  5.0 70.0
  6.0 48.0
  7.0 20.0
  8.0 14.0
  ENDDATATABLE

The following fields are required:

1. Data Table Name (string)
2. Data Table Type (string). The following types are supported, with additional types in development:

  * *LIST*. List of couples time-values. 

3. List of times and Values (e.g., "time0 value0 time1 value1 ..." list of alternating times and values)
4. The card **MUST FINISH** with an ENDDATATABLE command in its own row.

LIST data entries
"""""""""""""""""

If the data table is of type LIST, values are specified by alternating the time and the quantity of interest at that instant in time. An example is ::
  
  DATATABLE TABLE1 LIST
  0.0 0.0 
  1000.0 0.0
  ENDDATATABLE

**Note.** When entering, for example, scalar values for *PRESSURE*, *RESISTANCE*, *RCR*, etc. you need to enter the associated time, even if its value will not be read. The following example shows how to enter an outlet resistance value of 1000.0 Barye s/mL ::

  DATATABLE RTABLE LIST
  0.0 1000.0 
  ENDDATATABLE

SOLVEROPTIONS Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SOLVEROPTIONS specifies the option needed by the finite element solver. An example is ::

  SOLVEROPTIONS 0.01 10 1000 4 INLETDATA FLOW 1.0e-3 1 1  

The following fields are required:

1. Solver Time Step (double), 
2. Steps Between Saves (int), 
3. Maximum Number of Steps (int)
4. Number of quadrature points for finite elements (int), 
5. Name of Data Table for inlet conditions (string)

9. Stabilization. The following stabilization options are available:

  * *0*. No stabilization
  * *1*. With stabilization

OUTPUT Card
^^^^^^^^^^^

The OUTPUT card specifies the file formats for the program outputs. An example is ::

  OUTPUT VTK 0

1. Output file format. The following output types are supported:
 
 * TEXT. The output of every segment is written in separate text files for the flow rate, pressure, area and Reynolds number. The rows contain output values at varying locations along the segment while columns contains results at various time instants.
 * VTK. The results for all time steps are plotted to a 3D-like model using the XML VTK file format.
 * BOTH. Both TEXT and VTK results are produced.

2. VTK export option. Two options are available for VTK file outputs (need to specify for BOTH also):
 
 * 0 - Multiple files (default). A separate file is written for each saved increment. A **pvd** file is also provided which contains the time information of the sequence. This is the best option to create animations.
 * 1 - The results for all time steps are plotted to a single XML VTK file.

MATERIAL Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This card is used to specify a constitutive relationship between pressure, cross section diameter and thickness. Example are ::

  MATERIAL MAT1 OLUFSEN 1.06 0.04 120000.0 1.0 2.0e7 -22.5267 8.65e5
  MATERIAL MAT1 LINEAR  1.06 0.04 120000.0 1.0 7.1e4

The following fields are required:

1. Material Name (string)
2. Material Type. The following material types are currently supported:

  * *LINEAR*. Linear material model.
  * *OLUFSEN*. Modified material model. 

3. Material Density (double)
4. Material Viscosity (double)
5. Material Reference Pressure (double)
6. Material Exponent (double)
7. Material :math:`k_1` parameter (double)
8. Material :math:`k_2` parameter (double)
9. Material :math:`k_3` parameter (double)

**NOTE**: The reference pressure is the pressure associated with the undeformed area of the vessel. Typically this is the diastolic pressure for a specific vessel. Multiple reference pressures can be assigned to segments using multiple material models.

**NOTE**: For the OLUFSEN material model, all three parameters need to be defined, i.e., :math:`k_1`, :math:`k_2`, :math:`k_3`. For a LINEAR material model instead only the first material parameter :math:`k_1` is used and set equal to :math:`E\,h/r`, i.e., the product of elastic modulus and thickness divided by the radius.
